### Your AI-Powered Writing Assistant for Theses and Academic Papers

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
A **Next.js 15** application that delivers Google-Docs-like editing with instant grammar, spelling and style feedback.  Targeted at graduate students writing thesis chapters, the app combines a modern React UI with **Supabase** for authentication, data persistence and row-level security.  Autosave, versioning and readability analytics are built-in so writers can stay focused on their words, not their tooling.
